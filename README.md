## Calculator - The Odin Project

This is the README file for a Calculator project built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

### Project Description

This project involves creating a functional calculator that mimics the behavior of a standard on-screen calculator, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations.

### Learning Objectives

By building this calculator, I focused on:

* **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Reinforcing core concepts such as functions, variables, conditional statements and loops.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with the Document Object Model to create dynamic user interface elements.
* **Event Handling:** Implementing event listeners to respond to user interactions with the calculator buttons.
* **Logical Reasoning:** Designing the logic behind the calculator's evaluation of mathematical expressions.
